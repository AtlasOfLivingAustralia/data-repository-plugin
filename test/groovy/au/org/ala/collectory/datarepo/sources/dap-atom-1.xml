        <summary type="text">This data is a spreadsheet of label data of specimens from the flower beetle genus
            Metallesthes (including the species anneliesae sp. nov., metallescens and unicolor) which were inspected in
            collections. The spreadsheet was also used to create graphics that show seasonal occurrences of each species
            and statistics on the occurrence of the two sexes of each species in search of evidence for early male
            emergence. The paper which uses this data (and a link to the data is provided, including DOI) is "Revision
            of the genus Metallesthes Kraatz and description of Metallesthes anneliesae, a new species of Cetoniinae
            (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) from Queensland and New South Wales, Australia". Authors are Moeseneder,
            Hutchinson and Lambkin. In the paper the endemic Australian flower chafer genus Metallesthes Kraatz, 1880 is
            revised. Metallesthes anneliesae Moeseneder &amp; Hutchinson sp. nov. is described from southern Queensland
            and New South Wales. Metallesthes unicolor (Macleay, 1863) stat. rev. is raised from synonymy with
            Metallesthes metallescens (White, 1859). Metallesthes metallescens and Metallesthes unicolor are redescribed
            and their holotypes are figured. A specimen bearing a Nonfried type label is designated as the Lectotype of
            Metallesthes subpilosa Nonfried 1891. Metallesthes subpilosa syn. nov. is synonymised with Pseudoclithria
            ruficornis (Westwood, 1874). A key to the species of the genus is provided. Distribution maps are shown and
            known host plants are listed.

        <summary type="text">We present repeated stem measurement data from 20, 0.5 ha (100 m x 50 m) permanent
            rainforest plots in northern Queensland, Australia from 1971 to 2013. The plots have a rainfall range of
            1200 to 3500 mm, represent eleven vegetation types, six parent materials, and range from 15 m to 1200 m
            above sea level. Except for minor disturbances associated with selective logging on two plots, the plots
            were established in old growth forest and all plots have thereafter been protected. Plots were regularly
            censused and at each census the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all stems â‰¥10 cm DBH were recorded.
            Data is presented for 10998 individual stems with plot stem densities at establishment ranging from 476 to
            1104 stems ha-1. Due to the wide geographical range of the plots, no species dominate, although the families
            Lauraceae, Rutaceae and Myrtaceae contribute a large number of species. Basal area values at establishment
            ranged from 28.6 to 63.3 m2 ha-1 and showed no trend of increasing or decreasing over time due mainly to
            regular disturbance and recovery from natural events such as cyclones. In addition to stems â‰¥10 cm DBH
            data, we present height data, floristic data from understory stems (â‰¥50 cm height to &lt;10 cm DBH), an
            auxiliary species list (including vines, epiphytes, ferns, grasses, herbs and other life forms), and a list
            of voucher specimens lodged in herbaria. The data collected from the 20 plots provides an insight into the
            floristics, structure and long term forest dynamics of Australian tropical rainforests and allows direct
            comparisons to be made with long-term monitoring plots at a global scale.

        <summary type="text">The Australian National Wildlife Collection is a significant biodiversity resource aiding
            the study, classification and documentation of Australiaâ€™s terrestrial vertebrates (excluding fresh water
            fish) . In April 1976, it was formally recognised by its gazettal as the Australian National Wildlife
            Collection by the Commonwealth Government. &#xd;
            &#xd;
            The Australian National Wildlife Collection holds approximately 200 000 irreplaceable scientific specimens,
            including skins, skeletons, specimens in spirit, bird eggs, tissues and a wildlife sound library. The
            collection focuses on terrestrial vertebrates of Australia and Papua New Guinea and rodents of South-East
            Asia. There are also specimens from other parts of the world.&#xd;
            &#xd;
            ANWC research addresses the diversity, evolution, and conservation of Australia's wildlife, focussing on its
            systematics and taxonomy (study of evolutionary relationships among organisms) and biogeography.

            is one of the three largest plant collections in Australia. It is unique among the Australian Herbaria in

            &#xd;
            The Australian National Herbarium arose from the amalgamation over the years of several herbaria managed by
            the Commonwealth Government. These included several CSIRO herbaria, the Forest Research Institute Eucalypt
            Collection, the Forest Research Institute's Atherton Rainforest Collection, and the Australian National
            Botanic Gardens Herbarium. The CSIRO's core collection, previously known as 'Herbarium Australiense', was
            renamed 'Australian National Herbarium' in 1984.&#xd;
            &#xd;
            The Australian National Herbarium is a program of the Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research

            control and pollination for sustainable, secure food production. A key component of this work is knowing the
            function of a wide range of invertebrates that provide these services and understanding how these insects
            move around in differing landscapes. Most of our research projects revolve around the role of native
            vegetation in agricultural production systems. It is thought that by having an integrated approach to
            agricultural production and landscape management it will help to create a more pest suppressive landscape.
            Studies have shown that native vegetation provides a reservoir of natural enemies by providing them with
            prey and nectar. Therefore these natural enemies have the potential to colonise a crop quicker thereby
            suppressing pest populations. This particular project involved the use of 12 bi-directional malaise traps
            set up for a year (2007-08) in various habitats and differing landscapes (native vegetation and agricultural
            areas in the Lockyer Valley). This Herbarium collection consists of approximately 50 (dried &amp; pressed)
            native plant specimens collected from around these malaise traps.

            and/or genetic selection criteria, including, intramuscular fat, tenderness, different diets, exposure to
            different growth promotants and different genetic compositions. Many of the samples have been analysed for

            CSIRO, a number of publications contain results of these experiments. Many of the samples have been

            with the samples has been to understand the biological processes underlying important production traits.

            The collection specialises in Penicillium and Aspergillus species and their related teleomorphs,
            Eupenicillium, Talaromyces, Eurotium and Neosartorya.

            The collection also contains perhaps the most comprehensive collection of xerophilic fungi in the world,

            and supplying quality, fully documented tree seed to both domestic and overseas customers. Collections of
            seed are sourced from wild populations and genetically improved seed from its own domestication and
            improvement programs. The ATSC currently holds stock from over 1,000 Australian tree species. Represented
            genera include: eucalyptus, acacia, casuarina, grevillea, and melaleuca. The ATSC is the only organisation
            currently storing and conserving a wide range of Australian forestry plantation taxa which are economically
            important worldwide as raw materials for industrial and domestic use and play a significant role in
            environmental protection. Seedlots are available as bulk and individual tree collections. Germination tests
            are carried out on every seedlot in the store and has enabled the ATSC to create germination standards for
            many of the species. The ATSC maintains a database for all its seedlots with a subset of collection details
            and germination test results . The database contains detailed collection and germination information for all
            seedlots. The Australian Tree Seed Centre is a national facility for source identified seed and is managed
            by CSIRO Plant Industry as a collection and research centre.
